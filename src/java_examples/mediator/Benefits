The benefits here is that we can reuse the MachineMediator interface for all new Machine cycles (delicates, cottons etc.)
and also we can use all the Colleagues over and over for each one because those do not change.


Imagine having to go through and implement all these things for EACH Machine class. For example, making Button work
separately for CottonMachine or Valve working separately etc. and then working again separate for WhitesMachine etc.
