The Point here is that we have an XMLParser.

We have various types of XMLParser that we need to instantiate based on the specific type that is wanted by a client.

In order to do this efficiently we can use the Factory method.

So instead of instantiating with the new keyword by the client for every possible different type of XMLParser
in which case the client would have to know about all the subclasses.

We can just offer up a Factory method to our client to then use it by passing in the type of XMLParser that they want
and correspondingly return the appropriate XMLParser.
